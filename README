What is this resource?
This resource has been designed to make it easy, quick and free to set up blips on the map.

You will find a “config.lua” file where you will find a fivem docs link for the blips and colors codes.

How to install it?

- Download the file from the link: GitHub - fnaticSQUITCH/creablips
- Put the file in your resources and make sure you have written in the “server.cfg” “ensure sq_créablips”.
- Restart your server and the script is installed.
- No command is needed, the blips will be displayed directly
